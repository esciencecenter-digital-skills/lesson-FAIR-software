## Version control system

Using a version control system allows you to easily track changes in your software,
both your own changes as well as those made by collaborators.
There are many flavors of version control systems, ranging from older systems such as
CVS and Subversion to more modern ones such as Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar.
By configuring your version control system to use GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket,
you’ll even have backups of every version of the software you ever made.
Additionally, those platforms offer collaboration tools such as an issue tracker and project management tools,
and you’ll be able to use third-party services such as code quality checkers, correctness checkers, and a lot more.

> ## Using a version control system or a cloud storage system?
>
> What is the difference between using a version control system,
> and using a cloud storage system (Google Drive, DropBox, OneDrive, etc)?
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > Version control systems are software tools that keep a track of modifications done to the code.
> > They record all the edits and historical versions of the software.
> > Version control systems can take many forms. For instance, they might store objects in cloud storage.
> >
> > Cloud storage systems are service models in which data is transmitted and stored on remote storage systems
> > and made available to users over the internet. Too often, cloud storage overwrites previous information.
> >
> > A cloud storage with version control can prevent loss of information.

## Public repositories

Developing scientific software in publicly accessible repositories:

- enables early involvement of users,
- helps build collaborations,
- contributes to the reproducibility of results generated by the software,
- facilitates software reusability,
- and contributes to improving software quality.

Taken together, this ensures that your software has the best chance of being used by as many people as possible
while promoting transparency.

## Getting started with git and GitHub

Although there are different version control systems available,
``Git`` is the most feature-rich, modern and popular by a good margin.
The platforms [GitHub.com](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/product/)
and [GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) all have smooth integrations with ``git``.

A good starting point to learn about ``git`` is the [Software Carpentry git novice lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

> ## Making a public repository on GitHub
>
> Create a public repository onder your own GitHub account,
> and add a readme file to it.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > In your GitHub account page, click on the plus icon <kbd>+</kbd> that is next to your profile picture
> > and choose [New repository](https://github.com/new).
> > In this page, you can type a name in the ``Repository name`` box.
> > The ``Public`` option is selected by default.
> > Also, you can check the box ``Initialize this repository with a README``.
> > This will create a ``README.md`` file in your new repository.
